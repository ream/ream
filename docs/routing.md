# Routing

Ream has a file-system based router which supports Vue-powered pages and server routes.

## Pages

In Ream, pages are Vue Components exported from `.js`, `.ts` or `.vue` files in the `pages` directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.

**Example**: If you create `pages/about.vue` that exports a Vue component like below, it will be accessible at `/about`.

```vue
<template>
  <div>About</div>
</template>
```

## Dynamic Routing

Defining routes by using predefined paths is not always enough for complex applications. In Ream you can add brackets to a page (`[param]`) to allow dynamic path parameters (a.k.a. url slugs, like `:param` in Express-like server framework).

Consider the following page `pages/post/[pid].vue`:

```vue
<template>
  <p>Post: {{ $route.params.pid }}</p>
</template>
```

Any page like `/post/1`, `/post/abc`, etc. will be matched by `pages/post/[pid].vue`. The matched value will be sent as a route parameter to the page.

For example, the page `/post/abc` will have the following `params` object:

```json
{ "pid": "abc" }
```

Multiple dynamic route segments work the same way. The page `pages/post/[pid]/[comment].vue` will match the route `/post/abc/a-comment` and its parameters will be:

```json
{ "pid": "abc", "comment": "a-comment" }
```

### Catch all Routes

Path parameter can be extended to catch all paths by adding three dots (`...`) inside the brackets. For example:

- `pages/post/[...slug].vue` matches `/post/a`, but also `/post/a/b`, `/post/a/b/c` and so on.

Matched parameters will be sent as a route parameter (`slug` in the example) to the page, and it will always be a string, so, the path `/post/a/b/c` will have the following `params` object:

```json
{ "slug": "a/b/c" }
```

## Nested Routes

Vue Router's [nested routes](https://next.router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/nested-routes.html) feature is also supported.

```
/user/johnny/profile                         /user/johnny/posts
+-----------------------------+              +---------------------------+
| user/[user].vue             |              | user/[user].vue           |
| +-------------------------+ |              | +-----------------------+ |
| | user/[user]/profile.vue | |  +-------->  | | user/[user]/posts.vue | |
| |                         | |              | |                       | |
| +-------------------------+ |              | +-----------------------+ |
+-----------------------------+              +---------------------------+
```

To create children pages, put them in a folder with the same name as the parent page, for example:

```
- user/[user].vue
- user/[user]/profile.vue
- user/[user]/posts.vue
- user/[user]/index.vue
```

..is equivalent to following routes in vue-router:

```ts
;[
  {
    path: '/user/:user',
    component: loadComponent('user/[user].vue'),
    children: [
      {
        path: 'profile',
        component: loadComponent('user/[user]/profile.vue'),
      },
      {
        path: 'posts',
        component: loadComponent('user/[user]/posts.vue'),
      },
      {
        path: '',
        component: loadComponent('user/[user]/index.vue'),
      },
    ],
  },
]
```

## Route Name

Vue Router allows you to [assign a name to a route](https://next.router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/named-routes.html#named-routes) for various advantages, by default Ream automatically infers the name from the file path, for instance, following pages:

- `pages/index.vue` -> `index`
- `pages/user/[user].vue` -> `user/[user]`
- `pages/settings/[...slug].vue` -> `settings/[...slug]`

Basically it's just the file path but without the extension.

## Access the Router

```ts
import { useRoute, useRouter, useRoutePath } from '@ream/app'
```

[`useRoute`](https://next.router.vuejs.org/api/#useroute) and [`useRouter`](https://next.router.vuejs.org/api/#userouter) have the same API as in Vue Router, `useRoutePath` is a variation of `useRoute().path` which ensures the route path doesn't end with a slash, which is a common problem of static web hosting services.
