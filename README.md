## ATTENTION: this project is under development, we aim to make it usable when Vue 3 is out. (i.e. it's not going to support Vue 2)

## Goals / What is Ream

Ream is a full-stack framework that works similar to Next.js and Nuxt.js.

### Fullstack & Monolithic

Inspired by Laravel and Ruby on Rails, Ream will offer many features like `data fetching`, `auth`, `autorization`, `mail`, `validation` and/or `database` out-of-the-box or via official packages. 

### API Not Required

Data fetching on the client-side can be quite complex, good old web frameworks like Laravel allows you to directly render a view with data fetched on the backend, this is also available in Ream, see more about [serverPreload](https://ream.dev/docs/data-fetching#server-preload).

### Convention over Configuration

Ream made many decisions for you so you can enjoy a good experience with less effort, for example Ream offers a file-system based router, and adding `auth` is as simple as running a command. Remember how you integrate [Social Login](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/socialite) in your Laravel app? It will be as simple if not simpler.
